# Project-Investigate-a-Dataset-No-show-Appointment
We have been presented with data on non-show appointment in a clinic to explore the characteristics of patients who fail to show up on their appointment date with the aim of helping the management of the clinic to better stratigize on its patient appointment system in order to reduce the number of failed appointments in the clinic. It was the first project undertaken during my ALX-Udacity Nano degree in Data Analytics.

We downloaded the data manually and assess the data for tidiness and quality issue. cleaning operations such as removing duplicates, handling missing values and changing features data types were performed using python libraries such as numpy and pandas.

Data analysis and visualization was done using the seaborn and matplotlib libries and we discovered that the proportion of patients that fails to show up on their appoint date was 20.19%; majority of which were female who are within the age bracket of 18-36 years who were given appoint between  mondays to wednesdays and did not receive sms reminders for their appoints.

We recommend that the clinic should create awareness on the importance of not missing appointment dates, focusing more on females patients who between 18-36 years of age. And ensure that sms reminders to patients should be sent timely inorder to reduce the number of no-show in the clinic
